The global plant phenology data portal, or PPO data portal, is an aggregation of 
plant phenological observations from [USA-NPN](https://www.usanpn.org/usa-national-phenology-network), [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/), and [PEP725](http://www.pep725.eu/) representing 
20 million phenological observations from across North America and Europe.  The PPO data portal utilizes the [Plant
Phenology Ontology](https://github.com/PlantPhenoOntology/ppo/) (PPO) to align phenological
terms and measurements from the various databases. The rppo R package enables programmatic access to all data contained in the PPO data portal incuding selected classes contained in the PPO itself.  

For information on how data is assembled for the PPO data portal, visit the 
[ppo-data-pipeline git repository](https://github.com/biocodellc/ppo-data-pipeline).

## Installation

The production version of rppo is accessible on CRAN:
```{r}
install.packages("rppo")  
library(rppo)
```

You can install the development version of rppo from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rppo")
library(rppo)
```

## Examples

Following are a couple of brief examples to illustrate how to get started with rppo.  We recommend visiting the [rppo vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https:/x/github.com/ropensci/rppo/blob/master/vignettes/rppo-vignette.html) for a more complete set of examples on using the rppo package, as well as viewing man pages for rppo functions in the R environment, using `?ppo_data` and `?ppo_terms`.  

```{r examples}
# query all results from day 1 through 100 in a particular bounding box, 
# limited to 2 records
r <- ppo_data(fromDay = 1, toDay = 100, bbox="37,-120,38,-119", limit=2, timeLimit=5)

# view the data returned
print(r$data)

# view the number of possible records returned
print(r$number_possible)

# return a data frame of present
presentTerms <- ppo_terms(present = TRUE, timeLimit=3)

# print the 2nd present term returned
print(presentTerms[2,])
```
