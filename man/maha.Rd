\title{Outlier detection using Mahalanobis Distance}
\usage{
maha(x, cutoff = 0.95, rnames = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{dataset for which outliers are to be found}

\item{cutoff}{Percentile threshold used for distance, default value is 0.95}

\item{rnames}{Logical value indicating whether the dataset has rownames, default value is False}
}
\value{
Outlier Observations: A matrix of outlier observations

Location of Outlier: vector of Sr. no. of outliers

Outlier probability: vector of (1-p value) of outlier observations
}
\description{
Takes a dataset and find its outliers using modelbased method
}
\details{
maha computes Mahalanibis distance an observation and based on the Chi square cutoff, labels an observation as outlier. Outlierliness of the labelled 'Outlier' is also reported based on its p vlaues. For bivariate data, it also shows the scatterplot of the data with labelled outliers.
